# Vein-Finder
In healthcare, precise vein visualization is crucial, 
especially for patients with high adiposity levels. 
To address this, we've chosen to explore 
enhancing vein visualization through a light 
source. This non-invasive approach aims to 
simplify the process, reduce costs, and offer a 
patient-friendly solution. Our focus is on 
developing a device that improves the accuracy 
of vein imaging, ensuring a more efficient and 
comfortable experience for medical procedures 
in challenging patient populations.
